Many of the code was written, simply using examples that we did during the lectures, links to them:

The difficulties we faced, were mainly focused around the github submitions. We exerienced some merging issues, that resulted in the code
being deleted. There were also some difficulties with the level of knowlage/will surounding the difficulty of the task. We tried to split the 
work depending on how much each member knows, but there were troubles getting it done, so due to that there are some details choosen to do 
differently. The count for favourites is updated using .length instead of the GROQ count method. The games in favourites do not contain 
local storege and for that reason it disapears on every refresh.
